<h1>Help - HMI Client Protocol Library</h1>

<hr>

<h2>Overview:<a name="Overview"></a></h2>

<p>The HMI protocol client Javascript library comes in two parts. 
These are the JSON encoding library and the HMI protocol library itself.
</p>


<hr>

<h2>JSON and the HMI System:<a name="JSON and the HMI System"></a></h2>

<p>JSON is a standard data encoding format used in web applications. The HMI 
messages are encoded in JSON format. The HMI system can use standard JSON encoding 
libraries such as "json2.js" from <a href="http://www.json.org/">JSON.ORG</a>. 
With the increasing popularity of JSON, future versions of web browsers are 
expected to support it natively without requiring a separate Javascript library. 
</p>


<hr>

	<h2>HMI Communications Library:<a name="HMI Communications Library"></a></h2>

<p>The HMI communications library is implemented as a single Javascript object.
This library <strong><em>("libhmiclient2.js")</em></strong> does more than just 
support the HMI protocol. It provides the following features:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Encoding and decoding of messages using the HMI protocol.</li>
	<li>Buffered HMI reading and writing functions.</li>
	<li>Event and alarm handling.</li>
	<li>Automatic update of screen displays.</li>
</ul>


<hr>

<h2>The Read List:<a name="The Read List"></a></h2>

<p>The "read list" is an array of tag names that are to be polled (read) on a 
regular basis. The "read list" is a critical part of an application, because it
defines what data is available to the client for display.
</p>


<pre class="examples">

	Example - 

	// Make a list of all the address tags to be monitored. This is what we
	// send to the server asking for values.
	var ReadList = ["PL1", "PL2"];

</pre>

<hr>

<h2>The Zone List:<a name="The Zone List"></a></h2>

<p>The "zone list" is an array of zone names that defines the alarms and events
that are to be monitored.
</p>


<pre class="examples">

	Example - 

	// Make a list of the alarm and event zones to be monitored. Zones are
	// used to filter alarms and events to only those we are interested in. 
	var AlarmZoneList = ["zone1", "zone2", "zone3"];
	var EventZoneList = ["zone1", "zone2", "zone3"];

</pre>

<hr>

<h2>The Display List:<a name="The Display List"></a></h2>

<p>The display list is an array of code objects which control graphics, text, 
tables, etc. "UpdateDisplay" calls each item in turn, passes it the latest 
data, and asks	it to update itself. Each screen item must be a code object 
which exports a method called "UpdateScreen", and which accepts one parameter.
e.g. "objref.UpdateScreen(presentstate);"
</p>

<p>To add an item to the display list, create the object and pass it to 
"AddToDisplayList".
</p>

<pre class="examples">

	For example - 
	
		// This defines a pilot light control.
		var PL1 = new MB_PilotLight("green", "red", "black", "PL1", document);
		MBHMIProtocol.AddToDisplayList(PL1, "PL1", "read");

</pre>
	

<p>This creates a pilot light using "MB_PilotLight" (part of another library), 
assigns it to a reference called PL1, and passes it to "AddToDisplayList" 
along with two other parameters. 
</p>

<p>The second parameter is the "address label". This is used by instructions 
which need to read the input values. This should be a valid tag from the read 
list whenever the address label is "read". Its value is not significant for 
other address labels.
</p>

<p>The third parameter is the "tag type". This is a description of the type of 
address used in the second parameter. This determines the source of the data 
which is passed to the dislay item. Valid value are: "read" (input data from 
the read list), "timestamp" (the server time stamp from the last message), 
"stat" (the server stat value from the last message), "msgid" (the message id 
returned by the server), "events" (an array of the latest event messages), 
and "alarms" (an object containing alarms and alarm acknowledgements). 
</p>
	

<p>Alarms and alarm acknowledgements are contained in a single object in order
to fit both within the single parameter limit. This object has the following
form : {"alarms" : this._AlarmBuffer, 	"alarmsupdated" : this._AlarmsUpdated,
"alarmack" : this._AlarmAckBuffer, "alarmackupdated" : this._AlarmAckUpdated};
</p>

<p>In this example, "alarms" is the alarm input buffer. "alarmsupdated" is an
integer that increments whenever new alarms have arrived. "alarmack" is the
alarm acknowledgement input buffer. "alarmackupdated" is an integer that 
increments whenever new acknowledgement messages have arrived.
</p>



<hr>

<h2>Initialisation:<a name="Initialisation"></a></h2>

<h3>HMIClient(url, port, cid, readlist, alarmzonelist, eventzonelist, ansyncoption);</h3>

<p>This is the object name and the initialisation parameters.</p>

<ul>
	<li>url = The url (address) of the server, including address and path.</li>
	<li>port = The IP port of the server.</li>
	<li>cid = The client ID string.</li>
	<li>readlist = The IO read list.</li>
	<li>alarmzonelist (array) - List of alarm zone filters.</li>
	<li>eventzonelist (array) - List of event zone filters.</li>
	<li>ansyncoption = If true, uses asynchronous communication. If false,
		uses synchronous communications.</li>
</ul>

<p>The web browser will enforce a security policy requiring that the 
communications between the HMI web page and the server must be to the
same host (address) and port as the web page was loaded from. This means
the communications library needs to know the host name and port. This
can be accomplished in several ways. One way is to hard code these values. 
However, that means they must be known in advance. 
</p>

<p>The other way is to use a standard Javscript object to obtain 
these values automatically. These are:
</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>window.location.hostname</strong> - This automatically obtains 
		the host name (address).</li>
	<li><strong>window.location.port</strong> - This automatically obtains the
		port number.</li>
</ul>


<p>You must also decide whether to use synchrnous or asynchronous communications. 
With synchronous communications, the web browser waits for the server
to reply before continuing. With asynchronous communications, the web
browser does not wait. Rather, it sends the request and continues running
the browser script. When the response from the server is received, the
software function which handles the response is automatically called and 
the display list is updated. 
</p>

<p>When the web browser and the server are communicating on a reliable local 
network (or on the same computer), there is normally no noticable difference
between the two methods. However, if the network is slow or unreliable, using
the synchronous method can cause the web browser to appear to "stall" or be
unresponsive. Also, if the server is stopped and restarted for some reason, the
web page will require a reload (press "F5" or click on the "reload" icon) before
communications will resume.  
</p>

<p>When asynchronous communications is used, these problems will not occur. The
communications library will automatically keep retrying communications. However,
some versions of some web browsers when running on some operating systems may have 
bugs or other problems which prevent asynchronous communications from working
correctly. This rarely occurs. However, since applications using  asynchronous 
communications are relatively new, this feature is not as well tested in all
browsers as the synchronous method. If problems are encountered when using
asynchronous communications, it is suggested to try setting the "ansyncoption" 
parameter to "false" to see if the synchronous method will work instead.
</p>

<pre class="examples">

	// Make a list of all the address tags to be monitored. This is what we
	// send to the server asking for values.
	var ReadList = ["PL1", "PL2"];

	// Make a list of the alarm and event zones to be monitored. Zones are
	// used to filter alarms and events to only those we are interested in. 
	var AlarmZoneList = ["zone1", "zone2", "zone3"];
	var EventZoneList = ["zone1", "zone2", "zone3"];

	/* This handles communications with the server. 
	The parameters are: 
		1) The host name the web page was loaded from.
		2) The port number the web page was loaded from. 
		3) The client ID string.
		4) The list of tags to poll for data.
		5) The list of alarm zones to poll for new alarms.
		6) The list of event zones to poll for new events.
		7) true = Enable asynchronous communications.
	The first two parameters use a standard Javascript feature.
	Alternatively, these can be hard coded values if the host
	and port are known in advance.
	*/
	var MBHMIProtocol = new HMIClient(window.location.hostname, 
				window.location.port, "Any client name string.", 
				ReadList, AlarmZoneList, EventZoneList, true);

</pre>

<p>There should only be <em>one</em> HMI communications object in an application 
that takes care of <em>all</em> polling. 
</p>

<p>The "same origin" security policy in most web browsers requires that a web client
application can only communicate with the same host that the web page was loaded
from. This means that a single server must be used as the source of the web page
and as the source (and destination) of all data. 
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Updating the Read List Dynamically</h2>

<h3>SetReadList(readlist)</h3>

<ul>
	<li>readlist: (array) = An array of strings containing the
	list of address tags to read from the server.</li>
</ul>

<p>The read list can be updated while the system is running. 
</p>

<pre class="examples">

	MBHMIProtocol.SetReadList(NewReadList);

</pre>

<p>This will change the read list that was set as part of the initialisation
process. This is <strong><em>not</em></strong> normally necessary. It 
<em>may</em> be useful in reducing the amount of data polle in some larger 
applications. If you are not sure whether you need this feature, you probably 
do not need it. 
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Reading and Writing:<a name="Reading and Writing"></a></h2>

<h3>AddWrite(writetag, writeval);</h3>

<ul>
	<li>writetag = The tag to write to.</li> 
	<li>writeval = The value to write </li> 
	<li>Adds a write request to the output queue.</li> 
</ul>

<pre class="examples">

	MBHMIProtocol.AddWrite("PumpSpeedCmd", PumpSpeed);

</pre>

<h3>WriteImmediate(writetag, writeval);</h3>

<ul>
	<li>writetag = The tag to write to. </li>
	<li>writeval = The value to write. </li>
	<li>Similar to AddWrite, but instead of simply adding a request to the
	write queue, it forces an immediate polling cycle and screen update. </li>
</ul>

<pre class="examples">

		// Stop the pump.
		if (ButName == "PBStop") {
			PumpSpeed = 0;
		}
		// Update the new pump speed.
		MBHMIProtocol.WriteImmediate("PumpSpeedCmd", PumpSpeed);

</pre>

<h3>WriteToggleImmediate(writetag, reftag);</h3>

<ul>
	<li>writetag = The tag to write to. </li>
	<li>reftag = The reference tag.  </li>
	<li>Similar to WriteImmediate, but instead of simply writing a value, it
	sets the value of a tag to the boolean opposite of that found in a reference
	tag.</li>
</ul>

<pre class="examples">

	MBHMIProtocol.WriteToggleImmediate('PB2', 'PL2');

</pre>


<h3>WriteIncImmediate(writetag, reftag, incval, inclimit);</h3>

<ul>
	<li>writetag =  The tag to write to. </li>
	<li>reftag = The reference tag.  </li>
	<li>incval = The amount to increment by. This must be a numeric value. This 
	may be negative. </li>
	<li>inclimit = The absolute value of the increment limit. This must be a
	numeric value. </li>
	<li>Similar to WriteImmediate, but instead of simply writing a value, 
	it reads the value stored in "reftag", increments it by the number "incval",
	and stores the result in "writetag". "reftag" and "writetag" may be the same.
	If the absolute value of the result exceeds the number "inclimit", the result
	is set to zero. </li>
</ul>

<pre class="examples">

	MBHMIProtocol.WriteIncImmediate('PB4', 'PL4', 1, 6);

</pre>

<h3>function GetServerID()</h3>

<p>Read the value of the id string.</p>

<pre class="examples">


</pre>

<h3>function GetMsgStat()</h3>

<p>Read the value of the current message status.</p>

<pre class="examples">


</pre>

<h3>GetRead(readlabel);</h3>

<ul>
	<li>readlabel = The tag to read.</li>
	<li>Reads a value from tag address "readlabel". The value returned is the most
	recent value in the input buffer. </li>
</ul>

<pre class="examples">

		var PumpSpeed;
		// First, get the current pump speed.
		PumpSpeed = MBHMIProtocol.GetRead("PumpSpeedActual");

</pre>

<h3>GetTimeStamp();</h3>

<ul>
	<li>This returns the most recent server time stampe. The value returned is the one
	from the most recent message. </li>
</ul>

<pre class="examples">

		var TimeStamp = MBHMIProtocol.GetTimeStamp();

</pre>


<hr>

<h2>Event and Alarm Handling:<a name="Event and Alarm Handling"></a></h2>

<h3>AddAlarmAck();</h3>

<ul>
	<li>This adds the alarm at the head of the alarm queue (the oldest unacknowledged 
	alarm) to the output queue. </li>
</ul>

<pre class="examples">

	MBHMIProtocol.AddAlarmAck();

</pre>


<hr>

<h2>Display Control:<a name="Display Control"></a></h2>

<h3>AddToDisplayList(objref, addrlabel, tagtype);</h3>

<ul>
	<li>objref = A reference to the display object.</li>
	<li>addrlabel = If the tagtype is "read", this is the address label the display 
	object is attached to. If the tagtype is not "read", the value in this parameter
	is ignored.</li>
	<li>tagtype = The type of tag.</li>
</ul>

<p>This adds an HMI display Javascript object to the display list.
	The "addrlabel" must be a valid tag which is part of the read list.
	The "tagtype" is a string, and may be "read", "timestamp", etc. (see below). 
	Each of these tag types refers to a valid HMI field from which it derives 
	its data.
</p>

<p>The display list is automatically updated whenever new data is received
from the server.
</p>

<pre class="examples">

	// This defines a pilot light control.
	var PL1 = new MB_PilotLight(document, "PL1", "black", "green", "red");
	var PL2 = new MB_PilotLight(document, "PL2", "black", "green", "red");

	// Now, add each of these screen objects to the list of things to update.
	MBHMIProtocol.AddToDisplayList(PL1, "PL1", "read");
	MBHMIProtocol.AddToDisplayList(PL2, "PL2", "read");

	// This is for the alarm status display on the main screen.
	var AlarmStat = new MB_PLMultiColour(document, "AlarmStat", 
				"black", ["white", "green", "orange", "red"]);
	MBHMIProtocol.AddToDisplayList(AlarmStat, "", "unackalarm");

</pre>

<h3>HMI Tag Types:</h3>

<ul>
	<li>read - Use the data from the tag given as the second parameter.</li>
	<li>timestamp - The message time stamp.</li>
	<li>serverid - The server id.</li>
	<li>stat - The message "stat" parameter.</li>
	<li>msgid - The message id number.</li>
	<li>alarms - The alarms.</li>
	<li>alarmhistory - The alarm history.</li>
	<li>events - The events.</li>
	<li>errors - The errors.</li>
	<li>status - The message status.</li>
	<li>chkalarm - Check if alarms present (see below).</li>
</ul>

<p>For "chkalarm" alarms, the HMI display object will be passed the 
following values:  
</p>


<ul>
	<li>0 - No current alarms present.</li>
	<li>1 - At least one unacknowledged alarm in the "ok" state.</li>
	<li>2 - At least one acknowledged alarm is still active ("ackalarm"). </li>
	<li>3 - At least one unacknowledged alarm in the "alarm" state.</li>
</ul>

<p>Higher number codes take priority over lower numbered codes.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Polling Cycle Control:<a name="Polling Cycle Control"></a></h2>

<h3>SendRequest();</h3>

<p>This triggers a communications polling cycle. However, it does not 
<em>schedule</em> the polling request. Scheduling the polling request must be
done by other means. Typically, you would use "setTimeout", which is a standard
web page Javascript event. In the example below, the function "RunScanCycle" is
being scheduled again in 1000 milliseconds. 
</p>

<p>The polling time to use will be a compromise between several factors. If the
time between polls is too long, there will be a noticable lag between a physical
event happening and indication of it on the display. If the time between polls is
too short, the load on the computer displaying the HMI client (and possibly the
server as well) will be too high. 
</p>

<p>Also, if asynchronous polling is used, and if the time between polls is too 
short, the server will not have had enough time to respond before the client
begins to send the next poll. If this happens, the connection will be aborted
and the client will not receive the reply. In these cases, it is better to 
either use synchronous communcations (this is set via an initialisation parameter)
 or to use a slower polling rate. 
</p>

<pre class="examples">

	// Run all the operations required each scan cycle.
	function RunScanCycle() {

		// Query the server for updates.
		MBHMIProtocol.SendRequest();

		// Call the function back again at the set interval.
		window.setTimeout("RunScanCycle()", 1000);
	}

</pre>

<hr>

<h2>Communications Watchdog:</h2>

<h3>CommsWatchDogTimeOut(limit);</h3>

<ul>
	<li>limit = The amount of difference permitted between the number of 
	messages sent and received before an error is reported.</li>
</ul>

<p>This function is useful only when using asynchronous communications.
The "SendRequest" function keeps track of the number of requests sent
and received. If too many consecutive requests are sent without a response
from the server, "CommsWatchDogTimeOut" will return "true". This may be used 
to annunciate a loss of communications on the screen. The count of requests
is automatically reset every time a response is received, so an occasional
loss of messages will automatically correct itself when the next response
is received.
</p>

<p>If communications is lost, a valid response message will <strong>not</strong>
be received, which in turn means the display list will not be called to update
itself. If you wish to display a message to the operator, you should call
the appropriate function directly yourself. If you are using one of the client 
display library functions, you may do this by called the "UpdateScreen") 
method directly.  
</p>

<p>This method is an alternative to using the watchdog list. The watchdog list
method using "SetCommsWatchDogTimeOut" and "AddToWatchdogList" is recommended 
for most normal applications. 
</p>

<pre class="examples">

	// Run all the operations required each scan cycle.
	function RunScanCycle() {

		// Query the server for updates.
		MBHMIProtocol.SendRequest();

		// Check the comms watch dog counters.
		ComsTimeOut = MBHMIProtocol.CommsWatchDogTimeOut(10);
		if (ComsTimeOut) {
			CommWD.UpdateScreen(1);
		} else {
			CommWD.UpdateScreen(0);
		}

		// Call the function back again at the set interval.
		window.setTimeout("RunScanCycle()", 1000);
		
	}

</pre>


<h3>SetCommsWatchDogTimeOut(limit);</h3>

<ul>
	<li>limit = limit (integer) - The amount of difference permitted
			between the number of messages sent and received before an 
			error is reported. This is a count, not a time value.
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Set the limit to be used when checking the communications
watchdog limit via the watchdog list. The watchdog function 
checks if responses are being received from the server by 
comparing a communications counter to the limit.
</p>

<pre class="examples">

	// Set the watchdog limit to 10 scans.
	MBHMIProtocol.SetCommsWatchDogTimeOut(10);

</pre>

<h3>AddToWatchdogList(objref);</h3>

<ul>
	<li>objref = A reference to the display object.</li>
</ul>

<p>Add an item to the watchdog list. This is similar to the 
	"display list" but is only for the communications watchdog counter. 
	Objects on this list are scanned and automatically updated each time a
	request is sent. The watchdog function passes a 1 to the display function 
	if the communications watchdog counter has exceeded the limit, or 0 
	otherwise. 
</p>

<pre class="examples">

	// This is for the communications watch dog display. 	
	var CommWD = new MB_PilotLight(document, "CommWatchDog", "black", "green", "red");
	// This is the watchdog list, not the regular display list.
	MBHMIProtocol.AddToWatchdogList(CommWD);
